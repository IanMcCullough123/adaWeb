        Äda 'web is named after lady ada augusta lovelace. She is considered
        to be the inventor of the concept of software and is renowned as the world's first programmer. 
        Besides being a scientist, she was also a poet, a musician, and a society woman who was very much involved with her
        contemporary culture.

        Äda 'web was operated by numerous people as part of internet content company WP
        Studio. After WP Studio was purchased by AOL, the site lost its
        financial support. In late 1998, it was archived by curator Steve Dietz
        on behalf of the Walker Art Center.
