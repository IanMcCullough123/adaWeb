      <h1>History & Background</h1>
      <p>
        Ã¤da 'web was established in the early spring of 1995 with the goal to
        provide contemporary artists (visual artists, as well as composers,
        movie directors, architects, choreographers, etc), a station from which
        they can engage in a dialogue with users of the internet. Ã¤da has been
        on the web since February 1995.

        Ã¤da 'web owes its name to lady ada augusta lovelace, also known as ada
        byron. aside from being lord byron's daughter, ada was a scientist. her
        collaboration with british mathematician charles babbage led her to
        invent an operating system for his difference engine. she is considered
        to be the inventor of the concept of software. lady ada was also a poet,
        a musician, and a society woman who was very much involved with her
        contemporary culture. in a sense she is our museâ€¦

        Ã¤da 'web was operated by Matteo Ames, Cherise Fong, Ainatte Inbal,
        Andrew Wanliss Orlebar, Andrea K Scott, John F. Simon, Jr., Benjamin
        Weil, Vivian Selbo, and others, as part of internet content company WP
        Studio. After WP Studio was purchased by AOL, the site lost its
        financial support. In late 1998, it was archived by curator Steve Dietz
        on behalf of the Walker Art Center.
