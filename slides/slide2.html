      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>
        Founded in 1994 by John Borthwick and Benjamin
        Weil, äda 'web operated as a platform that embraced the digital realm, 
        including online art, experimental literature, 
        publishing, and exhibitions. As a pseudo-internet startup, it facilitated  
        partnerships between artists, web designers, and developers, thus 
        fostering an environment where the internet could be explored 
        as a canvas for creativity and as a channel for widespread 
        distribution. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This distinctive collaborative nature of the site empowered 
        äda 'web to break free of confines associated with
        net art. It presented a variety of works by artists who specialized 
        in digital media, as well as those who regarded engagement with the internet 
        as a seamless extension of their conceptual artistic pursuits.
