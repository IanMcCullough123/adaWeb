      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>
        Founded in 1994 by John Borthwick and Benjamin Weil, äda 'web emerged as
        a unique platform that embraced the digital realm, encompassing online
        art, experimental literature, publishing, and exhibitions. Serving as a
        pseudo-internet startup, it facilitated partnerships among artists, web
        designers, and developers, fostering an environment for exploring the
        internet as a canvas for creativity and widespread distribution. This
        collaborative approach allowed äda 'web to transcend the confines of net
        art, presenting diverse works by artists specializing in digital media
        and those who viewed internet engagement as a seamless extension of
        their conceptual artistic pursuits.
