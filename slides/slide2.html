      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>
        Founded in 1994 by entrepreneur John Borthwick and curator Benjamin
        Weil, äda 'web was a platform for online artworks, experimental
        literature, publishing, and even exhibitions. It functioned within an
        internet startup as a “digital foundry” that commissioned artists to
        work directly with web designers and developers to explore the internet
        as medium and distribution channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        This collaborative approach allowed äda 'web to diverge from conceptions
        of net art as a distinct field of practice: it included works from
        artists who focused on digital media and from artists for whom net
        engagement was a welcome extension of their conceptual practice.
