      <h2>The Web As a Medium</h2>
      <p>The web has emerged as a unique medium for artistic expression, 
        setting itself apart from traditional art forms in several ways. Unlike 
        conventional art, which is often static and confined to physical spaces 
        like galleries and museums, web-based art thrives in the virtual realm, 
        allowing artists to create immersive and interactive experiences. With the web, 
        artists can incorporate various multimedia elements, from text and images 
        to videos, animations, and interactive code. This multimodal approach 
        enables them to engage with audiences on a deeper level. Additionally, the web offers
        a global stage for artists, providing them with the opportunity to reach large
        audiences instantly. It makes art accessible to anyone with an internet connection,
        democratizing the art world in a way that was previously impossible. Web-based 
        art, thus, not only introduces innovation in form and content but also redefines 
        the nature of artistic collaboration, exhibition, and audience engagement.
